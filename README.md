# Motion-Photo-Extractor
Extracts a "motion photo" video from pictures created by Samsung Galaxy smartphones.

# Usage
Simply run the Python script using the following command:
`python motionphoto_extract.py image_file [output_file]`
Where image_file is the input image, and (optional) output_file is the output video filename.

Note that the image must have been taken with a phone that has "Motion Photos" enabled for motion photos to be saved inside the photos.
